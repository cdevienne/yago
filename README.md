# Yet Another Go ORM

Yago is an attempt to create an ORM for Go.

## Features

- SQLAlchemy inspired
- based on the 'qb' database toolkit (https://github.com/aacanakin/qb),
- based on non-empty interface and code generation as 'reform' does
  (https://github.com/go-reform/reform/)

## Current state:

- Very experimental.
- Current focus is on finding the right API.

In no way using this code in production is a good idea.

Feel free to come and discuss the design, propose patches...
